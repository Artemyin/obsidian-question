I understand the necessity of deadlines and work under pressure but I handle pressure really well, always trying to stay calm and focus on prioritizing my work step by step, doing my best and avoiding to deliver something wrong.



Commonly work under pressure could be caused by big amount of work or new kinds of work.

Usual I review all actual task, make prioritization, break down on short steps. Looking for persons who could be a predecessors for my tasks, already done similar job, or have enough experience to able for help. 

With very difficult tasks, i try to estimate complexity.  I trying to recognize bottlenecks or my blind points and find people who familiarize with this kind tasks. And send them letter with some crucial questions.  It helps me systematize my current knowledge. Often this letters stays unsent.

What are the expectations of me in my first 30 days working here(on the trial period)?

What do you think are some of the companyâ€™s biggest challenges right now?

What can you tell me about the company culture, are there many social events outside of work?

Will you let me know if I am not successful? Are candidates normally notified if they are not successful?

Could you describe a typical day in this job?

Can you please tell me more about the day to day responsibilities?

What are you looking for in a candidate?

[[How to Pass Your Job Interview in English]]
# Tell me about a time when you had to joggle several projects at the same time. How did you organize your time?

- I was working at a firm of marketing agents when we had three big clients who all needed marketing campaigns at the same time. 
- I was asked to balance my work so that I could work on each project successfully. 
- At first I felt overwhelmed, and I spoke to my boss to explain the situation. She gave me some great suggestions about scheduling my time so that I could focus on each project for several hours at a time, and diverting calls about the other projects to another person. 
- Fortunately, it worked well and I learned a lot about time management and multitasking.

# Describe the best partner or supervisor you’ve worked with. What part of their management style appealed to you?

- Well, I think that during my first job as a waiter I had a manager who influenced my own people skills and management skills. He was patient and flexible, but strict when it came to the job itself. 
- I needed to make sure that I was always doing my best because he respected me and I respected him. 
- I was able to pick up some of his style when I was there, and it’s never left me. 
- Looking back, I think he was the main reason I have been so successful in this industry.

# Tell me about a time when you were asked to do something you had never done before. How did you react? What did you learn?

- There was one time where I was working as an I.T. specialist and my supervisor was suddenly unable to make it to a team meeting. 
- My supervisor asked me to head the meeting in her place that morning, and to tell her about it afterwards. 
- I managed to do it successfully because I’d watched her head the meetings so many times before. 
- Looking back, I am glad that I didn’t have days to think about it, because this way I learned that management wasn’t as intimidating as I'd believed.

# Describe a situation where you needed to persuade someone to see things your way.  What steps did you take?  What were the results?

- Well, I think that when I was working as an engineer for my last employers I needed to persuade them to design their products in a simpler way. 
- I decided to illustrate my points by showing them how much more efficient and cost-effective it would be to make just one or two adjustments to an already established product, rather than changing everything without knowing if it would work. 
- In the end it was a great outcome, because they agreed with me and it opened up communication with them in ways I couldn't have anticipated.

# Tell me about one of your favorite experiences working with a team and the contributions you made?

- I was working at a language school as a teacher when we had a huge summer school program to design and teach together. 
- I was given a deadline to design one of the sections of the curriculum, and I decided to call a meeting with the other teachers so we could all integrate our classes together. 
- I suggested that we have a big outdoor event at the end of the course to consolidate everything the students had learned in an active way. 
- It was a great success not only for the students but also the whole team as teachers, as we bonded and achieved our aims as a team.

# Give an example of a time when you delegated an important task successfully.

- One time when I was working at Big Farmer as an Advertising Manager, I was responsible for choosing my team and for delegating who would work on each part of the advertising campaign for a launch of a new product line. 
- I decided to consider not only what my team had already done successfully on past projects, but also how they really wanted to grow. 
- It was a great success, because my team were more motivated than they would have been if they were just doing what they always did.

# Recall a time when you were assigned a task outside of your job description. How did you handle the situation? What was the outcome?

I was working at a call center as a customer service representative and the management  were understaffed, so they asked me to give training to a new group of employees coming in. I had to make sure that they were all ready to take calls in their second week. I did some research about how to train new teams for the job I’d been doing for a year, and I did it without complaining that it wasn’t in my job description. After the experience, I feel more confident about my own skills and my ability to train others — and I gota promotion.

# Tell me about a time when you were communicating with someone and they did not understand you. What did you do?

- There was a situation once when I was training a new employee on the step-by-step process of a new product launch, and he was having difficulty following how one step lead to the next. 
- I had to make sure that all the new employees were clear about this, so I decided to demonstrate it by giving him a tour around the different teams working on different stages of this process. I was a little concerned that my approach would just make people feel ridiculed, but fortunately it worked well and that approach to the training has now become standard.

(i made presentation for my own skill attestation, and when we had new teammates i used for describing our project)

# Tell me about the biggest change you have had to deal with? How did you adapt to that change?

I was in a situation once where my company merged with a larger company, and all the rules suddenly changed. I had to adjust quickly to new colleagues and a new boss as well. I managed to do it because I knew that the change was actually better for both the company and for myself — there would be great opportunities to grow. The outcome was that my positive attitude was noticed and that I was able to develop more over the next few months than I would have if I’d refused to accept the change.


# What's the biggest career goal you've achieved?

I had been working on the software development of a new video game over a number of years, and when it was finally completed and launched I was allowed creative control over some aspects of the next game. I was responsible for designing the code that would be at the heart of the game. I suggested that we do things entirely differently from before, and my ideas were welcomed. The outcome was that the game was an even greater success than the one before, and this is the biggest career goal I’ve achieved to date.

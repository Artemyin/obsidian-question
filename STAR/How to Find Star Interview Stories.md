[[How to Pass Your Job Interview in English]]
With behavioural interviews you never know exactly which question they will ask you...

How can we prepare?
What stories do we need?

### Stories from
A: Professional life
B: Personal life

### We prepare 2 kinds of stories
1: Positive achievement story
2: Negative ( but here is what I learned...)

## POSITIVE:
- Positive stories or moments in your personal or professional life
- 2 or 3 Positive stories or moments

## NEGATIVE:
- Negative stories or moments in your life, **BUT** you learned something.
- 2 or 3 Negative stories or moments in your life

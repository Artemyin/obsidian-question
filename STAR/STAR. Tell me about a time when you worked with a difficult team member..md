>**One time when I was working on** a large project a team member started to get very stressed and it was really affecting her job performance. The problem was that she was starting to be more and more rude with me, instead of asking politely for the things she needed from us, she started to give orders and verbally abuse me and other staff members.

>**I needed to** be careful to never take it personally or react in the same way as her but after it happened a few times, it was clear the behavior needed to stop.

A — action

>**I spoke to my supervisor to explain the situation** and at the end of the day **we were asked to** have a meeting with him about it

R — result

>My manager explained the situation to her about how I and other team members were feeling and she apologized for her behavior and saying that she had been working too much recently and was under a lot of stress at home. She apologized for her behavior and it never happened again. **The result was that** she didn’t repeat the behavior but **looking back I should have** spoken to my supervisor after the first time it happened. What I learned was that I can’t control other people’s behavior but I can control mine, and that it’s important to stay calm when dealing with difficult team member or customers.

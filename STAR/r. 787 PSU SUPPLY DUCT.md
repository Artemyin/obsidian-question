#interview 

It was first time when i faced PSU commodity on 787 so I got familiarized with it. Also met people whose responsible for part ordering process on that project, which got me bigger understanding of inner business processes.

The result was that this solution was approved on all stages of drawing release process. 
I finished work in time to meet the deadline and **fortunately it worked out well.**

I will be ready to start **by** next week/next month
By = not later than

>I'm available whenever you need me to start. I’m not working at the moment so I’m free to start immediately.

>I have a few projects to get wrapped up before I can leave, as well as basic training for my replacement to ensure a smooth transition, so I think 6 weeks is how long I need.

>Well for me it would be ideal to start in 2 weeks but if you need me to start earlier I’m sure we can work something out.

>Well as you know for me to take up this position I will need to relocate so I think realistically I could take up the position at the start of May.

>I think realistically i could start next month. I need to give written notice to my current employer 4 weeks before the end of my current employment.

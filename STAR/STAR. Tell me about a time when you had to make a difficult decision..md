>**Well I think that** of the most difficult decisions I had to make was when **I was asked** to lay off 3 employees in my department due to budget cuts. The company was not doing well in the recession.

T — Task

>**I was responsible for** choos**ing** 3 people out of 18 people to lose their jobs.

A — Action

>It was really difficult but **I decided to** choose people based on how much experience they had with the company. **I had to** have meetings with those people individually and **explain the situation to them.** Obviously they were not happy but they accepted that there was no other choice.

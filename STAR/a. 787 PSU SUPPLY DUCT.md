However, after analyzing incoming documentation  we discovered that the old supplier ducts installed on the aircraft were outdated and not anymore available for ordering. Moreover, the connection type used in these ducts was likely "bell joint," which was no longer common for actual design. The actual design guide for the  design recommends  use  "beaded end" connections. Its mean that these two types of ducts is not compatible to each other.

To solve this issue, I develop four preliminary design options. After discus with tech-lead we choose two suitable designs.  
I made 3D layout for check system intersections, and integrations. create presentation with pros and cons of that solutions and show it to costumer.Â 

The first solution involved using one of removed duct with length that fit in the new stowage bin and bond a silicone cap to its free end. This solution seemed simple and cost-effective.

The second option was to use PVDF ducts. This type of ducts uses in actual design practice. But this would require to bond a silicone sleeve to the old pipe to join the duct's beaded end.

After careful consideration, we chose the second option because it was a reliable solution that could also accommodate future modifications.

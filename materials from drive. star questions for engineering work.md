TEAMWORK questions

- Tell me about a time when you worked well as part of a team.
    

  

We had a 787 project that involved mainly the ICS system. Before starting work on this project, we needed to review the IDR for each aircraft that went through the modification. This was a substantial amount of data. We needed to review all of the IDR and determine which ones related to our system and write down which IDR number corresponded to which kit.

We would organize a meeting to discuss how best to divide the workload among ourselves. If it is one big task, we discuss how to break it down into smaller pieces of work. If necessary, we create an Excel table where we write a list of all the tasks and start taking turns working on them, marking ourselves next to the task we're working on. This way, if any task turns out to be more time-consuming, other team members can take on more tasks, but overall, everyone spends roughly the same amount of time.

If it is a larger job, such as replacing diffusers on a 737, we can work on the kits in parallel, then check each other's work, and advise each other in the process to find errors while drafting.

INITIATIVE / LEADERSHIP questions

- Can you tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership skills.
    
- Are you able to delegate responsibilities efficiently?
    
-   
    

It was a project about modifying 737 airplane, which involved changing the sidewall panels and installing emergency COS boxes and corresponding ducts and hoses in these  areas. This type of work is always very labor-intensive and requires more time for investigation.

I was focusing on another project, but we had two new team members which i mentored. 

As i understood their skills and abilities i propose scheduled plan for assigning  events for team members which i mentored, I was took into consideration their strength and weakness and  short time to complete tasks.  I helped them during completion their tasks, answered on their questions and suggestion useful standards and documentations

As result it was good plan for complete events, by the way there were enough of mistakes during approving. I understood that I need to investing more time in their investigation skills,  and ask send me for checking their investigation information before completing the work.

  

- How do you respond to criticism?

PROBLEM-SOLVING / PLANNING questions

- What do you do when facing a problem?
    

  

In my opinion, the most effective method for problem-solving is to reuse previously approved projects that have similar tasks. If I am unable to locate any suitable projects, I will adhere to the best design practices and standards that are relevant to the system.

If I am unable to discover a solution for my task, I will develop multiple options within the design guides and standards, and document the advantages and disadvantages, execution, installation, maintenance, and modification processes. If necessary, I will consult with a more experienced colleague and make any necessary design adjustments.

Once I have proposed the options to the project leader, they can discuss them with the client and decide on the best course of action for the project.

  

- Tell me about a serious problem you had at work?
    
- Tell me about a time when you faced an unexpected problem?

NTERPERSONAL SKILLS / CONFLICT questions

- Tell us about a time when you needed to deal with a conflict at work.
    
- Describe a situation when you had a disagreement with a colleague.
    

The approach I take and the amount of effort I put into persuading my boss depend on my level of expertise. Firstly, I need to clearly communicate my stance and present several potential options while highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. It's important to look at the problem and possible solutions from multiple perspectives. However, sometimes, I may miss important details or not be aware of the nuances that can impact the decision. Asking for clarification on every detail can be time-consuming.

For instance, when I suggested attaching the cover to the existing pipe as a solution for the PSU panel issue, it appeared to be the most viable option to me. It's cost-effective, easy to implement, and can be quickly drafted in 3D and on drawings. Nevertheless, my boss informed me that this modification could result in the loss of the pipe's modification potential, and they were considering another option, namely, silicone sleeves.

This example shows that I based my opinion on what I believed to be the best solution, without fully considering the customer's requirements. As an engineer, I am entrusted with many opportunities to implement my work and a considerable amount of responsibility. Therefore, in such circumstances, I strive to gain knowledge and understand the perspectives of my more experienced colleagues.

PRESSURE / STRESS questions

- What's the most stressful situation you've faced at work so far? How did you handle it?
    

  

The challenge was to modify the ICS (Integrated Cooling System) when we were left without a lead and an experienced teammates.  Since the system was made of titanium pipes, the design approaches were different. It was challenging to design the modification, as well as to do the work instructions and notes.

I reviewed many previous designs and asked my colleagues from Long Beach for their help. 

After external check there were no major markaps. After completing two such modifications, I became more confident in performing this type of work, checking and identifying errors. In the future, there no feedbacks with markup on the ICS system, which I consider to be a good indicator of success.

  
  

- What advice would you give to calm down a colleague who's stressed out about a deadline?
    

  

One such situation was at the beginning of 2022. We prioritized tasks, sorted the most urgent ones in a table, and tasks that could be done quickly. And keep updated each other during week if somebody stack or need help with something.

We completed tasks related to ICS systems which was time consuming, but higher priority.  while also receiving SB reviews that I had not done before, but they had a higher priority, so I took them as overtime to complete them.

When I was working on OFAR and also checking work on ICS and other packages, I combined the work. As they say, "rest is a change of work activity." So, to change my focus and rest from one job, I switched to another.

When there are many tasks to complete, and I get stuck on something, I write an email with questions that I have, and while waiting for a response, I start working on another less urgent task. This allows me to change focus, and when I return to the previous task, I can look at it with fresh eyes and new information.

-Tell us about yourself.

I graduated in Kyiv Polytechnic Institute with a degree in mechanical engineering technology and gained extensive experience working on two major projects at ProgressTech Ukraine.

  

On the RENTON WING SUSTAIN 737 project, I worked as a performer and checker for about three years, supporting the production of the wing and stabilizer of the Boeing 737 aircraft. Our team followed a Kanban approach, where each engineer was responsible for a small piece of work, and we mainly focused on planned changes, value engineering work, and drawing conversion. I gained valuable experience in drawing creation and execution, information search using various tools.

On the BGS ECS MODIFICATION project, I worked for about three years on the modification of life support systems for all aircraft types. I was responsible for analyzing incoming documentation, performing and checking work, reviewing service bulletins, mentoring, and communicating with Boeing focal points.

My personal interests include space exploration, new technical developments, programming, and crypto technologies. I also enjoy spending time with friends, hiking in the mountains, and reading books, including popular science, science fiction, and classical literature. Additionally, I have a passion for arts and enjoy origami and drawing.

-Why do you want to leave your current job?

Due to family circumstances, I had to leave Ukraine, but the current policy at ProgressTech restricts me to work only from specific city, which is not compatible with my current situation. Despite this, I value the pleasant work atmosphere, the challenging Boeing projects, and the opportunity to collaborate with very intelligent colleagues. I hope to continue working with them in the future.

  

-Strengths and weaknesses?

In terms of my strengths, I excel in the following areas:

- Results-oriented: I focus on achieving the end goal and take proactive steps to accomplish it.
    
- Honest: I value integrity and believe in being transparent and truthful in all my interactions.
    
- Willing to acknowledge my mistakes: I am not afraid to admit when I am wrong and take corrective actions to make things right.
    
- Fast learner: I am able to quickly grasp new concepts and adapt to changes with the guidance of mentors.
    
- Building relationships: I enjoy working in a team and building relationships with colleagues. I am always willing to share my experiences and lend a helping hand.
    

When faced with a difficult new task in a project, I found similar completed works and contacted an engineer who provided necessary information and valuable advice. This helped me complete the work on time and avoid final stage corrections.

On the other hand, my weaknesses include:

- Frustration with big amount of new information : When a task involves a lot unfamiliar information, tools and processes,  I sometimes get overwhelmed and frustrated. However, I try to overcome this by reading the task multiple times, making a list of unclear items, break the task down into smaller pieces and work from the general to the specific and consulting experienced colleagues for additional information and standards.
    
- boring for big amount monotonous work: While I do not compromise on the quality of my work, I can sometimes become lazy when it comes to repetitive tasks. I try to think of new methods that can speed up the completion of these tasks.
    
- Need for improvement in English language skills: As a non-native English speaker, I recognize the need to improve my language skills. To achieve this, I consume news and entertainment media in English, take online courses, and attend speaking clubs.
    

Furthermore, I believe that it is important to seek help from a colleagues when stuck on a problem or unable to find a solution after multiple attempts.

  

-Tell me about checklists and quality control.?

We used checklists when performing work, and each type of work had its own checklist. Each item on the checklist had a link to a standard or document that explained the item, and there were also examples of right and wrong ways to do things. We used checklists during the work, at the end for self-checking, and for internal checks.

After completing a task, we record completed task into a quality control table where we noted the number of internal and external errors, the date of submission for approval, and other relevant information. Based on this data, we created tables and graphs to monitor and control quality. We could track how well we were meeting the acceptable levels, and if we exceeded those levels, we conducted a quality review meeting to discuss why the situation occurred and how to avoid it in the future.

  

-Tell me about a time you were overly tasked. How did you manage your time?

One such situation was at the beginning of 2022. We prioritized tasks, sorted the most urgent ones in a table, and tasks that could be done quickly. And keep updated each other during week if somebody stack or need help with something.

We completed tasks related to ICS systems which was time consuming, but higher priority.  while also receiving SB reviews that I had not done before, but they had a higher priority, so I took them as overtime to complete them.

When I was working on OFAR and also checking work on ICS and other packages, I combined the work. As they say, "rest is a change of work activity." So, to change my focus and rest from one job, I switched to another.

When there are many tasks to complete, and I get stuck on something, I write an email with questions that I have, and while waiting for a response, I start working on another less urgent task. This allows me to change focus, and when I return to the previous task, I can look at it with fresh eyes and new information.

  
  

- Describe workflow on the project?
    

Our workflow begins with the receipt of various types of documentation, such as ITCM, work package cover sheet, and IDR (in some cases). Once these are received, I am responsible for the following tasks:

- Assigning the event in Stealth to myself
    
- Investigating the incoming documentation
    
- Creating incoming and outgoing configuration in IVT
    
- Creating a 3D layout in Catia with the necessary reference geometry
    
- Creating a kit and a QMAP
    
- Performing a self-check on the kit before it goes to internal check
    

After performing these tasks, I assign approvers in the QMAP and event from Stealth and submit the kit for the approving process. The approvers include DE, ME, FLAM, STRESS, SYSTEMS, and GROUP. If there are any mistakes, I correct the QMAP and the approving process continues. Once the kits are approved, the responsible engineer compiles a TOP kit that contains all subkits. Based on the TOP kit, a Service Bulletin is created that serves as an instruction for MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Operations).

  

- Challenge?
    

The challenge was to modify the ICS (Integrated Cooling System) when we were left without a lead and an experienced teammates.  Since the system was made of titanium pipes, the design approaches were different. It was challenging to design the modification, as well as to do the work instructions and notes.

I reviewed many previous designs and asked my colleagues from Long Beach for their help. 

After external check there were no major markaps. After completing two such modifications, I became more confident in performing this type of work, checking and identifying errors. In the future, there no feedbacks with markup on the ICS system, which I consider to be a good indicator of success.

  

- how do you review SB?
    

we find needed Service Bulletin in BERST

We use coordination sheet in eSPEC, completed kits, top-kits.

and compared revised Service Bulletin with these info

if i find some inconsistencies i make a comment or send letter  for responsible engineer with my mark-ups

  

- How would you deal with a large volume of work with several staff members off work?
    

We had a 787 project that involved mainly the ICS system. Before starting work on this project, we needed to review the IDR for each aircraft that went through the modification. This was a substantial amount of data. We needed to review all of the IDR and determine which ones related to our system and write down which IDR number corresponded to which kit.

We would organize a meeting to discuss how best to divide the workload among ourselves. If it is one big task, we discuss how to break it down into smaller pieces of work. If necessary, we create an Excel table where we write a list of all the tasks and start taking turns working on them, marking ourselves next to the task we're working on. This way, if any task turns out to be more time-consuming, other team members can take on more tasks, but overall, everyone spends roughly the same amount of time.

If it is a larger job, such as replacing diffusers on a 737, we can work on the kits in parallel, then check each other's work, and advise each other in the process to find errors while drafting.

  
  

- What would you do if you had a different opinion from your boss about how to do something?
    

The approach I take and the amount of effort I put into persuading my boss depend on my level of expertise. Firstly, I need to clearly communicate my stance and present several potential options while highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. It's important to look at the problem and possible solutions from multiple perspectives. However, sometimes, I may miss important details or not be aware of the nuances that can impact the decision. Asking for clarification on every detail can be time-consuming.

For instance, when I suggested attaching the cover to the existing pipe as a solution for the PSU panel issue, it appeared to be the most viable option to me. It's cost-effective, easy to implement, and can be quickly drafted in 3D and on drawings. Nevertheless, my boss informed me that this modification could result in the loss of the pipe's modification potential, and they were considering another option, namely, silicone sleeves.

This example shows that I based my opinion on what I believed to be the best solution, without fully considering the customer's requirements. As an engineer, I am entrusted with many opportunities to implement my work and a considerable amount of responsibility. Therefore, in such circumstances, I strive to gain knowledge and understand the perspectives of my more experienced colleagues.

  

- what is ECS is?
    

The Environmental Control System (ECS) on an airplane is responsible for maintaining a comfortable and safe environment for passengers and crew throughout the flight. The ECS controls the temperature, humidity, air circulation, and air quality in the cabin and cockpit.

The ECS operates using a combination of air conditioning, heating, ventilation, and pressurization systems. The air is usually taken from the compressor stage of the aircraft's engines and then cooled, filtered, and distributed to the cabin through air ducts. The air is then recirculated and filtered to maintain a clean and comfortable environment.

The ECS also controls the pressurization of the cabin to maintain a comfortable level of air pressure at high altitudes. This is necessary because the atmosphere at high altitudes is too thin to provide sufficient oxygen for humans to breathe, so the cabin needs to be pressurized to a level that is safe and comfortable for passengers and crew.

In addition to maintaining a comfortable environment, the ECS also plays a critical role in maintaining safety on the aircraft. For example, the ECS provides fresh air to the flight deck to prevent hypoxia, which is a condition caused by a lack of oxygen. The ECS also helps to prevent the buildup of harmful gases and fumes in the cabin, which could pose a health risk to passengers and crew.

consist of next systems:

AIR VENTILATION

AIR SUPPLY

E/E COOLING

ICS

OXYGEN EMERGENCY

FIRE PROTECTION

GASPER

  
  

- how ECS works?
    

Air takes from the engines at 4 and 8 compressor stages, than this air goes to 

  

Air conditioning packs: The air conditioning packs are located in the aircraft's belly and are responsible for cooling and pressurizing the air. They use a combination of hot and cold air sources, such as the engine bleed air and the APU (Auxiliary Power Unit), to create a comfortable cabin environment.

  

after it air goes to mix main fold

where air separates from excessive moisture and mix with recirculated air than air goes to raisers and stream into main overhead ducts

  

from overhead air supply ducts air distribute by sidewall diffusers.

  

air from passenger cabin through grilles near floor panels goes to cargo compartment, were it may use for e/e equipment and for circulating through hepa filters which is located near mix manifold

  

there is remarks that for cockpit uses safe separate line right from the air conditioning pack

  

ventilation ducts use negative pressure  for remove old, stale air from the compartment, and out through an outflow valve

  

- How ICS works?
    

ICS (Integrated Cooling System) are part of an aircraft's environmental control system. The ICS is responsible for providing cooling to various areas of the aircraft, while the Galley Cooling Unit specifically cools the galley and food storage areas.  These systems use heat exchangers to transfer heat and titanium tubes to transfer coolant.

The heat exchanger is a critical component of the system, as it allows for efficient transfer of heat between the coolant and the outside air. The use of titanium tubes in the heat exchanger allows for a lightweight and durable design, ideal for use in aircraft. The coolant used in these systems, typically a mixture of water and Propylene glycol, is non-toxic and has a low freezing point, making it well-suited for use in high-altitude environments.

- parameters controlled by the ECS?
    

The values of the parameters controlled by the Environmental Control System (ECS) on an airplane vary depending on several factors, such as the aircraft type, the altitude, and the outside temperature. However, here are some typical values for each parameter:

1. Temperature: The temperature inside the cabin is usually maintained between 18°C and 25°C (64°F and 77°F) for passenger comfort, although it can be higher or lower depending on the airline and aircraft type.
    
2. Humidity: The relative humidity in the cabin is typically kept between 10% and 20% to prevent dryness and discomfort. However, the humidity level can drop to as low as 5% in some cases.
    
3. Air circulation: The ECS is designed to ensure that the air is circulated throughout the cabin evenly, with a typical flow rate of 1 to 2 cubic feet per minute per person.
    
4. Air quality: The ECS filters the air in the cabin to remove dust, smoke, and other contaminants, and maintains the oxygen level at around 21%. The carbon dioxide level is usually kept below 0.5%.
    
5. Cabin pressure: The ECS maintains a comfortable cabin pressure at high altitudes, typically equivalent to an altitude of 6,000 to 8,000 feet above sea level.
    

It's worth noting that these values are approximate and can vary depending on the specific aircraft and its configuration. Additionally, some airlines may adjust these parameters based on their own policies and standards.

  

- materials used in ECS?
    

In ECS uses:

plastic

composite

PVDF

SIlicon

  
  

- what i would add to work process?
    

I am interested in deepening my understanding of the ECS calculation process. Upon reading the noise control document and design methods, I discovered that in cases where there is excessive noise in specific areas of the system and the exact source of the noise cannot be identified on the aircraft, a mock-up of that part of the system is constructed to facilitate locating the noise source. I am eager to learn about various design and analysis techniques for air systems.

During one of the aircraft modifications, we had to replace orifices on some ducts. There was a plate with the coordinates of the ducts and the orifices' part numbers, indicating that they were replaced as part of the modification. However, I do not know how the calculations were conducted. I would like to fill these knowledge gaps and increase my expertise in the system's development and processes.

In terms of improving our work process, I propose incorporating regular training sessions to enhance our knowledge and skills, particularly in areas where we lack experience or understanding. This would not only improve our individual performance but also help us work more efficiently and effectively as a team. Furthermore, I suggest conducting periodic reviews and analysis of completed projects to identify areas for improvement and learn from our successes and failures.

  
  

- do you like this project?
    

I really like this project. It's an interesting system that's very diverse, as there were assignments related to fire suppression systems, oxygen systems, and ISC systems. The BGS business process was designed for quick development and configuration changes in the aircraft. The drafting requirements are lower, which allows us to work much faster.

I also liked that the project intersected with some working groups, primarily payloads, since their changes have an effect on us, and wiring, since our changes may have an effect on them. This provides an opportunity to meet with engineers from neighboring teams, exchange experiences, and know who to turn to if there are any questions.

Additionally, the project is relatively new, and many working processes are still evolving. There is an opportunity to personally influence some of these processes, make suggestions, and be heard. Initiatives that focus on quality control are especially welcome.

  
  

- Approach in design?
    

In my opinion, the most effective method for problem-solving is to reuse previously approved projects that have similar tasks. If I am unable to locate any suitable projects, I will adhere to the best design practices and standards that are relevant to the system.

If I am unable to discover a solution for my task, I will develop multiple options within the design guides and standards, and document the advantages and disadvantages, execution, installation, maintenance, and modification processes. If necessary, I will consult with a more experienced colleague and make any necessary design adjustments.

Once I have proposed the options to the project leader, they can discuss them with the client and decide on the best course of action for the project.

- Tell us documents which you use for work process or tell us some particular standard?
    

I use PSDS and standard boeing search tool for searching standards, also most important standards noted in checklists.

  

I don’t remember information in that standards. On my opinion the most important is skill to find information. 

  

And i know were and how to find needed information.

  

Some documents difficult to find, so it's nice to ask colleagues who can help you.

  
  

- 787 UK PSU SUPPLY DUCT?
    

The 787 underwent a series of modifications, which included the installation of an OFAR (Overhead Flight Attendant Rest), as well as changes to the seating layout and lavatories, resulting in adjustments to the overhead stowage bins and PSU (passenger service unit) configuration.

In terms of the PSU supply duct design rules, the modifications required the ducts to be shortened to match the new bin length. However, we faced challenges when we discovered that the old supplier ducts installed on the aircraft were outdated and not readily available for ordering. Moreover, the connection type used in these ducts was possibly "bell joint," which was no longer common. The design guide for the actual design calls for the use of "beaded end" connections.

To address this issue, I presented two potential solutions. 

The first involved using a removed duct and bonding a silicone cap to its free end. This solution seemed simple and cost-effective. 

The second option was to use PVDF ducts from the new PSU design, but this would require to bond a silicone sleeve to the old pipe to join the duct's beaded end.

 After careful consideration, we chose the second option because it was a reliable solution that could also accommodate future modifications.

  

- 787 UK OFAR, OHSB PLENUMS?
    

There were modifications to the 787, including the addition of OFAR(Overhead Flight Attendant Rest), changes to the seating layout and lavatories, which affected the overhead stowage bins and PSU(passenger service unit) layout.

OFAR(Overhead Flight Attendant Rest)

For the OFAR installation, I was tasked with designing modifications to the ECS supply, including the installation of PVDF ducts, heater, humidifier, and smoke evacuation valves. Although I struggled a bit at the beginning, it was an excellent opportunity to learn as it was my first OFAR installation project.

  

OVERHEAD STOWAGE BINS PLENUMS

Additionally, we needed to align the air supply plenums as the lavatory location and seating configuration had been altered. I designed the removal, installation, and reinstallation of the air supply plenums using production modules from the incoming and outgoing configurations. This was a challenging task for me, and there were no prior similar tasks completed by more experienced colleagues on our project. However, with the help of the payload team, we were able to complete the task successfully.

  

- 787 ICS?
    

A major change was made throughout the entire aircraft. In particular, the galleys were changed and one supplemental cooling system was added. It was the first time I worked with an IDR (installation deviation record) - our team had already completed such a project, but there were problems during assembly at the MRO, and they sent feedback on how they fixed the problems. And since the aircraft configurations were the same, we used this information during the new design.

During this work, I encountered the ICS (integrated cooling system) for the first time, as well as the  working with tubing design and titanium tubes in general. There were also huge amount of notes and work instructions. It was my first time encountering rework of some parts. Overall, it was an interesting experience.

  
  

- 787 fire extinguisher ballon?
    

fire extinguisher ballon in enovia Addition of a larger fire extinguishing tank for 787(ETOPS) Extended-range Twin-engine Operations This change was fully processed through enovia and catia in the 3d model. 

It was necessary to create sub kits, kits, top kits. perform their CAO, and release.

  
  

- 777 OFAR REMOVALS?
    

The OFAR removal project, production drawings and models for this aircraft were made in catia v4, and it was extremely inconvenient to use them for the new design. Experienced employees said that in such cases it is necessary to use screenshots and cover up callouts in a possible way. 

Since only the cap was installed in this kit, I described its installation schematically in the drawing, and created an 3D layout with the model correctly instanced in space.

  

- 737 sidewall panel difusores, orifice,  FIRE EXTINGUISHER?
    

sidewall panel diffusers 

A project to modify the 737, which involved changing the sidewall panels and installing emergency COS boxes and corresponding pipes in this area. This type of work is always very labor-intensive and requires more time for investigation.

  

orifices 

On some projects, such as modifications to the 737 or 777 where there are many changes in the number or location of galleys, lavatories, etc., orifices are sometimes changed on the main pipes. Specific pipe coordinates are often provided indicating which ones need to be replaced and with which part numbers.

  

fire extinguisher balloon in PDM 

Replacing the fire extinguisher balloon with a larger size. The peculiarity is that the kit is fully processed in PDM without releasing drawings.

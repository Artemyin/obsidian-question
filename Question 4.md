# What are your weaknesses or weak points ?

Weak = adjective
Weakness = noun

We all hate this question!

A simple strategy

## Confession and recovery

Confession = Explain your weak points
Recovery = explain what you are doing to be better at
your weak points


## I feel that my weakness is...
Impatience
l am critical of my own work
my lack of experience
Lack of = not enough


## Ihave to admit that I...
I sometimes need to be a better listener
I have to admit I sometimes miss small details

I feel that my English is my weakest point


## But...
## l am working on this....

To work on something = to continue to work with something over time

To work on a big project


But...

I am working to get better at this
I am always working hard to be better at this

I feel that my management skills are my weakest point but I am constantly working on them to get better at managing people

I have to admit that English is my weakest point but I am constantly working on my English everyday to get better and improve.


> I feel that my weakness is my shyness or my lack of experience, but I have been working on this for a long time.

> I think my biggest weak point is that I sometimes fixate too much on small details, I have really been working on learning to stop and look at the bigger picture, even when in the middle of a project and learn to make smarter decisions.

> I think my biggest weak point is that my work can be a little slow sometimes because I always want everything to be perfect but then things take too long.

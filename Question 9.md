l actually work better under pressure and I get great results from working under pressure.

**Overwhelmed** = to feel like you have too much to do

I focus on the task at hand to maintain the quality of my work

## I manage stress by... VERB + ING

going to the gym

having a good work life balance

maintaining good communication with my colleagues


>I understand the necessity of deadlines and
work under pressure but I handle pressure
really well, always trying to stay calm and
focus on prioritizing my work step by step,
doing my best and avoiding to deliver
something wrong.And after work I manage
my stress by drinking with my friends or
playing video games.

>I always do my best to react to situations,
not stress. If I have a really difficult
customer or a stressed out team member I
try to focus and see what is the best
decision at that moment.

>The stress that comes from deadlines is
really healthy for me, it helps me maintain
structure as I focus on delivering what was
promised on time.

>I always make sure to take some time for
myself in the day, even if it’s just a quiet 10
minute coffee in the morning, this really
helps me manage my stress and stay
consistent in my performance.

>Although working in this’ kind of
environment can be stressful I think clear
communication with the team is key, when
team members take on too much work but
don’t realize it, it’s up to me the team leader
to make sure they get as much support as
they need.

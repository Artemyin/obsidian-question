ETL form my first project. Андрияшевский Виталий, он создал дружескую атмосферу. Всегда был рад ответить на вопросы, как конкретно по работе, так и вообщем по нашей компетенции. Когда приходила новая работа, он кратко рассказывал что надо выполнить. а потом мог спросить об этой части самолета в части теории, как эта деталь изготавливается, как устанавливается, как работает. когда у нас было свободное время, скидывал инетерсные документы и обучающие материалы которые помоглаи в работе. Благодаря ему, в свободное время  я начал изучать самолет в IVT, смотреть системы, читать материалы и наглядно смотреть на самолет. Когда я менял работу, это очень пригодилось, те знания что я приобрел во время самостоятельного изучения, позволили мне пройти собеседование на другой очень классный проект. так что считаю, его подход к завлечению сотрудников привнес много выгоды, как для самих сотрудников так и для команды.

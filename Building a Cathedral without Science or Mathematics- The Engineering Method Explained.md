﻿This structure built some 12,000 years  ago — that’s 6,000 years before Stonehenge,  0:14

5,000 years before the first pyramid  — highlights that for millennia,  0:17

humans have used the engineering method to  solve problems long before the rise of science.  0:23

In this video I define and illustrate the essence  of the engineering method. This is Göbekli Tepe,  

Göbekli Tepe

0:30

an ancient ruin in southeastern Turkey. Stone  structures cover nine hectares, about eighteen  0:35

football fields. Filled with circular rooms,  its purpose remains a mystery. Embedded in  0:41

the stone walls of the rooms are decorative  T-shaped pillars. Carved into the pillars are  0:46

lions . . . bears . . . wild boars . . . lizards  . . . spiders, and surprisingly . . . . ducks.  

Precision of Göbekli Tepe

0:56

Not only are the stones beautifully carved, they  are placed with precision. To see the degree of  1:02

precision look at the circular room I showed  you initially. At the center are the remains  1:07

of two T-pillars (the tops fell off long ago).  If we look at this room from above — keep you  1:13

eye on the two central pillars highlighted  in red — you see two circular rooms nearby,  1:19

which each have the same arrangement of pillars  at their center. The pillars in the two rooms at  1:25

the bottom sit on a line — with little deviation.  If we locate the exact centers between the pillars  1:31

in the two lower circles and connect them to  the center of pillars in the circle above,  1:36

we inscribe an equilateral triangle; its sides  deviate less that one point five percent from  1:42

perfection — this is unlikely to be coincidental,  nor the result of some self-organization.  1:48

My point is that these stones are erected in  a purposefully designed layout, not haphazard,  1:54

that responds to societal needs, which means that  Göbekli Tepe is an engineered object. The people  2:01

of Göbekli Tepe created all this by applying the  engineering method. The method we still use today.  2:09

Yet, this powerful method, the “engineering  method,” is an all but hidden process that few  2:15

of us have heard of—let alone understand — even  though it influences every aspect of our lives.  2:22

In this video series I explore the essence of  that engineering method. The age of Göbekli  2:28

Tepe highlights that the engineering method  long predates science, which conflicts with  2:33

the commonplace notion that engineering  somehow arises from the scientific method.  

Do Engineers Need Science?

2:39

So, I start by asking: do engineers  need science? And here’s the answer.  2:47

This is a model of Sainte-Chapelle, a stunning  thirteenth century building built nearly twelve  2:54

thousand years after Göebkli Tepe. Sainte-Chapelle  was designed and constructed by a team who had  3:00

never learned basic arithmetic or the  geometry taught today in third grade,  3:04

let alone anything we’d call “science.”  In fact, they had no standardized length  3:09

because a foot varied from region to region! The  medieval engineers aspired to create a building  

Gothic Cathedrals: Light

3:15

that celebrated a spiritual world by streaming  light through the structure’s walls. Sunlight  3:21

was transformed by the stained-glass windows into  a diffuse red, blue, and gold that glimmers on the  3:28

chapel’s sculptures and gilded arches. To create  these stunning displays of light, to house these  3:34

giant stained glass windows, they built vast walls  by constructing spectacularly high ceilings. How  3:40

did these engineers, called masons, know how to  crave a cathedral’s thousand of building blocks to  3:46

create, when assembled, not only beauty, but also  stability? Like all great engineers they drew on  3:52

past knowledge. They used an architectural element  that originated in present-day Pakistan. Notice  

Pointed Arches

3:59

that Sainte-Chapelle has, as do all cathedrals,  pointed arches — some six on the front, at least  4:06

ten on each side, and on the back six more. And  of course many pointed arches support the ceiling.  

Pointed vs Circular Arches

4:16

They chose this pointed arch over the arch used  in the Roman’s extraordinary Pantheon built about  4:22

fourteen hundred years before Sainte-Chapelle.  The Pantheon, typical of all Imperial Roman  4:27

architecture, features a semicircular  arch. It is exactly half of a circle.  4:33

If a medieval engineer used a semicircular  Roman arch to construct a soaring cathedral  4:38

it would cover entire city blocks, and use  so much stone that the cost would skyrocket.  4:45

The savings from using a pointed arch instead  of a semicircular arch can be clearly seen by  4:50

comparing Sainte-Chappelle with the Pantheon. Note  how Sainte-Chappelle is nearly the same height  4:56

as the Pantheon yet just a little over a third as  wide. This Roman semicircular arch was rejected by  

Width Circular Arch

5:03

medieval engineers because its width has to grow  proportionally to its height. To see the problem  5:09

consider a semicircular arch that is ten meters  in width. It is five meters in height because it  5:15

is half of a circle — so its height is half of the  diameter. Now, if I double the span covered — from  5:22

ten meters to twenty meters — you see that  the height is now ten meters: it has doubled.  

Width Pointed Arch

5:29

Contrast this to the pointed arch: as the arch  increases in height, the span covered can stay the  5:35

same because the shape of the arch can change as  its height increases. Although, medieval engineers  

Proportional Rule

5:41

didn’t adopt the Roman semicircular arch, from  the Romans they inherited the key idea that  5:47

enabled them to build their stunning cathedrals  that have stood for centuries. We can see it in  5:53

this arch from Sainte-Chapelle. To support  this arch, the medieval engineers had  5:58

to correctly size the thickness of this wall.  If this wall were too thin the weight of the  6:04

arch would buckle the wall — the structure would  collapse. If too thick, stone would be wasted (at  6:10

a huge cost) and the desired open space inside  the cathedral diminished. To size the wall,  6:16

the medieval builder used a rule that created  the stable semicircular arches of the Pantheon:  6:21

a stable arch results when the supporting wall’s  thickness is between a fourth or a fifth of the  6:27

arch’s span. If an arch’s span were this long,  then you’d divide it into about four equal parts,  6:33

and use one of one of these to size the wall’s  thickness. But, there a problem with applying this  6:39

proportional rule: the masons knew no mathematics  nor, as I’ve said, did they even have a ruler! So  6:46

this rule was not a calculation but was instead  an action. The mason would have a life-sized  

How Medieval Engineers Sized Walls

6:52

chalk drawing of the interior of this arch on  the floor of the drawing room. Now, instead  7:00

I’ve drawn the interior of a pointed arch  on a large sheet of paper. In addition to  7:05

this arch drawing or template you need a piece  of string — the mason would have used a rope.  7:10

I need to drap it over the arch so  I’ll insert map pins along the arch  7:15

to support the string — the mason would  have done this on the floor so he would  7:19

simply lay the rope on top of his drawing.  Now, drape the rope over the arch . . .  7:26

mark the string at the base of the arch . . . then  cut the string so it’s only as long as the arch.  7:39

Next, lay the string on the ground and fold  it into thirds — I’ve marked the thirds with  7:45

pink tape here, the mason would have used  colored chalk — that thirds isn’t obvious,  7:50

but it will get us to a wall thickness of about a  fourth or a fifth. With the rope now marked into  7:56

three sections of equal length . . . return it  to its original place along the arch template.  8:02

We see that this divides the arch into three  equal sections. Let’s mark one of them.  8:11

Then pin one end of a new  string to that marked spot.  8:18

Draw it taut and pin it to the base of the arch.  8:31

We need to attach to the base a length of  string exactly equal to the distance from  8:37

the spot a third of the way along the arch to  the base, so I just fold the rope and mark it.  8:44

And then draw that taut and in a straight line  with the pinned section, then pin it to the base.  8:50

The distance from that pin to the  inner line is the width of the wall,  8:54

which will be between a fourth and a fifth of  the arch’s span. Let’s compare it to the arch  9:00

section from Sainte Chapelle. If I superimpose  it on the string construction you can see that  9:05

it matches. It’s puzzling that we divided the  arch into three sections, which yielded a width  

Why Arch Divided into Three Section

9:10

between a fourth and a fifth, but that’s just  how the geometry works out — that’s part of the  9:16

rule. I’ve never worked out why geometrically  that works because it doesn’t matter: the mason  9:22

would never have worked it out analytically,  what matters — and that’s the point here — is  9:28

that it works. And to belabor the point a bit,  its the same rule the Romans used to size their  9:34

supporting walls. Divide the interior of a Roman  semicircular arch into three equal sized sections,  9:41

draw a line from one of these “third markings”  to the base of the arch, then double it … and  9:46

you see the wall size of a bit less than a fourth  of the interior arch’s span. With that rule we  

Rule of Thumb

9:53

have arrived at the core of the engineering  method. The proportional rule doesn’t come  9:57

from some scientific analysis of stone and its  properties. It comes from centuries of experience,  10:03

from trial and error. It is called a “rule of  thumb,” more formally a “heuristic,” an imprecise  10:09

method used as a shortcut to find the solution  to a problem, often by narrowing the range of  10:15

possible solutions. Here, a mason sized a wall’s  width in a matter of minutes without understanding  10:21

the fundamental material properties of stone  and without understanding the mathematics needed  10:27

to apply the rule. That’s a paradigm for the  engineering method: “Solving problems using rules  

The Engineering Method

10:34

of thumb that cause the best change in a poorly  understood situation using available resources.”  

Rule of Thumb Never Disproved

10:40

That’s a sharp contrast with the scientific  method, because these rules of thumb are only  10:45

guides that offers a high probability of success,  but no guarantee. And, unlike a scientific theory,  10:51

a rule of thumb is never, in a sense, disproved.  That hundreds of cathedrals are still around  10:57

today, standing for eight or nine hundred years  is proof of that! Instead of being disproved,  11:02

this rule of thumb for stone became outdated, not  wrong , as iron and steel I-beams replaced stone.  11:09

Yet, no doubt, there’s a question in your mind:  I’ve talked about buildings constructed eight  

Do Engineers Still Use Rules of Thumb?

11:14

or so centuries ago, so surely, you might wonder,  is engineering based on rules of thumb antiquated  11:20

in our scientific age? That line of thought  misunderstands the purpose of the engineering  11:26

method, which is to solve practical problem  before we have full scientific knowledge.

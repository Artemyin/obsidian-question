Hands-on labs

1. Identify the purpose and value of Google Cloud products and services. 
2. Choose among and use application deployment environments on Google Cloud: App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, and Compute Engine.
3.  Choose among and use Google Cloud storage options: Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, Cloud Bigtable, and Firestore. 
4. Interact with Google Cloud services. 
5. Describe ways in which customers have used Google Cloud


# Cloud computing

- **First**, customers get computing resources that are on-demand and self-service. Through a web interface, users get the processing power, storage, and network they need with no need for human intervention. 
- **Second**, customers get access to those resources over the internet, from anywhere they have a connection. 
- **Third**, the cloud provider has a big pool of those resources and allocates them to users out of that pool. That allows the provider to buy in bulk and pass the savings on to the customers. Customers don't have to know or care about the exact physical location of those resources.
- **Fourth**, the resources are elastic–which means they’re flexible, so customers can be. If they need more resources they can get more, and quickly. If they need less, they can scale back. 
- **And finally**, customers pay only for what they use, or reserve as they go. If they stop using resources, they stop paying.

# Why is the **cloud model** so compelling nowdays? 

1  - collocation - **renting** physical space
2 - virtualized data centers - match physical devices
user-contorled enironment
user-configured environment
3 - container-based architecture


# IaaS and PaaS

- infrastructure as a service, commonly referred to as IaaS, and 
- platform as a service, or PaaS.

laaS offerings provide:
- Raw compute
- Storage
- Network capabiities 
Oganized virtually into resources that are similar to physical data centers


PaaS offerings, in contrast, bind code to libraries that provide access to the infrastructure application needs. This allows more resources to be focused on application logic.

laaS model:
Pay for what they allocate

PaaS model:
Pay for what they use

Managed resources
Managed services

concentrate on buisnes goals and less on maintainin infrastructure


Cloud Functions
Manages event-driven code as a pay-as-you-go service

Cloud Run deploy containerized
microservices based application in a fully-managed environment

Software as a Service (SaaS)
Software as a Service applications are not installed on your local computer


Having multiple service locations is important because choosing where to locate applications affects qualities like availability, durability, and latency, the latter of

Latency measures the time a packet of information takes to travel from its source to its destination

Each of these locations is divided into several different regions and zones.

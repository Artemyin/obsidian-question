The INVEST criteria  
  
**Independent**, a story should be independent to prevent problems with prioritization and planning.  
  
**Negotiable**, they are not written contracts but are used to stimulate discussion between customer and developers until there is a clear agreement, they add collaboration.  
  
**Valuable**, stories should provide value to users. Think about outcomes and impacts, not outputs and deliverables.  
  
**Estimatable**, the story must be estimatable. If it is not, it often indicates missing details or the story is too large.  
  
**Small**, good stories should be small. This helps keeps scope small, and therefore less ambiguous, and supports fast feedback from users.  
  
**Testable**, stories must be testable so that developers can verify that the story has been implemented correctly and validate when the requirement has been met/is done.

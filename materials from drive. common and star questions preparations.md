5. Describe the best partner or supervisor you've worked with. What part of their management style appealed to you?
    

ETL form my first project. Андрияшевский Виталий, он создал дружескую атмосферу. Всегда был рад ответить на вопросы, как конкретно по работе, так и вообщем по нашей компетенции. Когда приходила новая работа, он кратко рассказывал что надо выполнить. а потом мог спросить об этой части самолета в части теории, как эта деталь изготавливается, как устанавливается, как работает. когда у нас было свободное время, скидывал инетерсные документы и обучающие материалы которые помоглаи в работе. Благодаря ему, в свободное время  я начал изучать самолет в IVT, смотреть системы, читать материалы и наглядно смотреть на самолет. Когда я менял работу, это очень пригодилось, те знания что я приобрел во время самостоятельного изучения, позволили мне пройти собеседование на другой очень классный проект. так что считаю, его подход к завлечению сотрудников привнес много выгоды, как для самих сотрудников так и для команды.

  
  

6. Tell me about a time when you were asked to do something you had never done before. How did you react? What did you learn?
    

It was time when we lost our ETL and experienced team, i was asked to do service buletin review,

it was new tool for work, new information and new responsibilities. I understood that i should do it, and this type of task will be encountered in the future.

It was the first time for me on EASA project, i asked to be responsible for it, as kits completely made in CATIA, without any additional software. and i had the biggest experience in catia drafting module, so i consent that i am most suitable person fro this project. 

It was the first time when i was responsible for all commodity on project, i make all analysis, all presentation and communicate with another teams, payloads, waterandwaste, electrical team.

10. Recall a time when you were assigned a task outside your job description. How did you handle the situation? What was the outcome?

and when i mentored him like i was studied. i gave him examples of analysis its a table in excel with product data, reference product data, effectivities, and more specific. He was good at looking up for information, but after he found similar kits, his analysis was vague or just copy pasta from old. but this steps is essential as it will have causing in future work. after situation were he made all task and while i checked his analisis  i realized that he is .. i asked him to send me for check his anays firstly
